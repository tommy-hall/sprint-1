What did I do well in this sprint?
Problem solving.  Whenever I found myself stuck on a problem I gradually worked my way through it until I had found a solution.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Time management, recording my time in a neat orderly system.

What can I improve on in the next sprint?
I can certainly improve on the the two points I mentioned in the last question.  I also believe that I can improve my over all success by applying some of the techniques we learned about in the time and habits resources.
