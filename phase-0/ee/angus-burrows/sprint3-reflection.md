What did I do well this sprint?
I did the redesign well, i found that changing my mindset to focus on functionality sped my process up.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't do the responsiveness as well as I liked. I would've wanted to make more @media changes for the text size.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Being more careful when paying attention to elements using responsive, and maybe going back and referring and trying some
 more functions for my own learning.
