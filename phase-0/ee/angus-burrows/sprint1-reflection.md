What did I do well this sprint?
    I did well the css and html exercise (make your website!) partially due to having previous experience

    What didn't I do well this sprint?
        I didn't do well the command line and github exercise. This was a good learning curve for me though, It's definitely getting use to it that I need.
        What can I improve on next sprint?
            I can improve on being more patient with new tools and skills, to ensure that I understand the intricacies a bit more and allow myself room to
            learn each and every individual function more than just the basics.
