 What did I do well this sprint?
 I did well in undestanding the sprint concepts, even though im not 100% confident in being able to write the code without clues.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 My time management kind of went out of the window this week, This was partly due to having a house move scheduled right inbetween!
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Being more honest to myself about my own expectations and the time spent.
