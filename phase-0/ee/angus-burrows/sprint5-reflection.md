What did I do well this sprint?
I did well in discovering the proper way to use loops and arrays
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 not being patient enough to work through it with intention
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 keep moving no matter what, use more pseudo code and get adjusted to using syntax that is used with writing loops
