What did I do well this sprint?
    I think I did well in excecuting a new feature to my site, where I was also able to fix some issues I was having
    with div's and site planning. This made me think of the function before the visual style which is one of the
    areas I would need to improve in order to maintain time management.

    What didn't I do well this sprint?
        I didn't do well in the branching exercise, this was a struggle for me. I learnt the concept of branches and
        the limitations and uses.

        What can I improve on next sprint?
            I can improve on my attention to the priorities of the sprint. I have been learning alot of context for
            the reasons why I am learning these new skills â€“ but often this leads me down a rabbit hole where I am
            actively distracted.
