What did I do well this sprint?
I improved my ability to apply consistent effort to something brand new to my own learning.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I didn't quite understand the mathematical side of JS which made me very careful about how
 I approached the complex parts of the material.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 In future I will be more commited to my sprint habits and allow myself to make more mistakes.
