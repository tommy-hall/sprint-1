 What did I do well this sprint?
    
    I've still been doing a consistently great job at chipping a little bit of work away each day. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    The sidebar on my individual blog pages still needs to be done but I'm still unsure about how I want to do it so I have left it the placeholders there for now. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?

    Looking forward to zhooshing up my site even more. It's a huge improvement to what it was originally. Lots of room for improvement but very proud of where it currently is.
