 What did I do well this sprint?
    
    This sprint I maintained my pace and have been prioritising my phase 0 work. I managed to attend a phase 0 check-in today, so I'm on track for the once-per-fortnight expectation.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    This sprint I didn't take advantage of playing around with Bootstrap and learning the ins and outs of it. I couldn't figure out how to get to the page where you only download parts of it and not the entire package.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

    I want to have a proper play with Bootstrap and test the functionality.
