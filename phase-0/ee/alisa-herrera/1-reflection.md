 What did I do well this sprint?
    
    This sprint I did well at prioritising phase 0 work and maintaining focus. I would work my sprint 1 tasks every evening after getting home from work. I was diligent with the assignments and made sure I was actually learning. I really enjoyed the homework!

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I like to go to bed early and I haven't been doing that this week. I need to ensure that what I'm doing is sustainable so I don't get burnt out before boot camp even starts.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

    Next week I need to prioritise my bed time!
