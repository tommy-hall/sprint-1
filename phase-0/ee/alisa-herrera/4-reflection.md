What did I do well this sprint?
    
    Still keeping an excellent pace. Very proud!

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I haven't had the mindful conversation yet. I haven't committed all the JavaScript principles to memory yet but I know what is possible so I can Google how to do it when I need to. I learn best this way.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

    I have been trying to incorporate mindfulness to all aspects of my life so I will work on improving and continuing that next sprint.
