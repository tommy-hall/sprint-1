What did I do well this week?
i had a serious amount of comitment issues this week, always posponing the tasks i had to do
and not getting around to doing them. although it took me forever to do them i guess
actualy forcing myself with my flatmates help and a wake up call from jack got me through.
honestly just getting it done is all i did well and that wasnt even done well, so, lots to improve on.

What could I have done to improve?
stop procrastinating, start prioritising and i should realy be asking for more help.
set times to do work, and just fucking do it. excuse the laungage but i am dissapointed in
myslef for the poor effort on this weeks tasks. hopefully it will push me to not fall into
this lazy habbit again.
