What did I do well this week?
I think worked past the problems i was having, rather than hitting a problem and
stopping untill i had the answer i just voiced the problem to harrison and
carried on. got alot of work done, proud of me :DD

What could I have done to improve?
there where mornings i woke up and was like ill do coding stuff later, and
although i did do it later i know i could be doing work at both times. i mean to
finish faze one as soon as i comfortably can, that being said i know i could have
finished this week sooner so its up to me to designate even more time to this
course. it is my potential futer after all.
