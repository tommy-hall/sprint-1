Why is reflection important?
it reinforces what you have learnt, im not to sure on the technical side but
once i've finnished studying i often talk to my friends about it telling and or
showing them what i've just learned. i find teaching somone else somthing you've
just learned is the best way to reinforce information, it just helps me make
sence of somthing putting it into my own words.

What did I do well this week?
TIMEBOX! timebox,timebox,timebox! i set aside the time and got the work done
with time to spare formyself which is nice.

What could I have done to improve?
i think not let myself get hung up on one thing, i need to get into the habit of
moving the task im stuck on to the blocked list and just moving onto the next
task. somtimes its hard because the next task might be an extention of the
original but there will be a new, unrelated task to work on while Harrison fixes
all my problems :P, shout out to Harrison!
