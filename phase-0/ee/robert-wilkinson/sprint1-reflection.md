What did I do well this sprint?


I persistently worked through problems, to get them working, eg the command line.



What didn't I do well this sprint?


I took a bit too long sorting out problems and I am hoping to improve on this, as I go through the course.



What can I improve on next sprint?


I can improve on the time it takes me to get through the tasks and I think this can be accomplished by being more confident in the abilities that you know already.
