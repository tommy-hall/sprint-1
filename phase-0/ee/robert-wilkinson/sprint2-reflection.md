What did I do well this sprint?


I felt that I did well with the coding this week and put good comments on the Udacity videos.



What didn't I do well this sprint?


I wasn't systematic going through the Udacity videos at first, but I have a better system now with taking notes as I go.



What can I improve on next sprint?


I just need to not panic, if i can't quite interpret the question at first. i just need to have a systematic way to get though tasks, if I think they could be time consuming or a little bit tricky.
