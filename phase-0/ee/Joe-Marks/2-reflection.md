I just followed the material and it seems that the coding form my past has helped me
a lot as its easier for me to problem-solve most things when I hit a wall.
I rarely ask for help because I'm usually scared that people will think I am dum.
I need to practice everything as I'm behind everyone-else but will catch up this week.
I did everything reasonable this week not sure what to improve other than my overall code tidyness and spelling and new code tricks
