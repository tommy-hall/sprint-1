I believe reflection is important because it allows us to see the things we need to change and the things we do not need to change. Reflection allows us to grow up in way. By reflecting on oneself we begin to more readily accept change when it hurtles our way. Identifying where oneself has gone wrong in any aspect of life helps the individual to learn, to grow, to be able to solve issues when they arise.

I think what I did well this week was to overcome my fear of the command prompt. And finding the time to start actually working on my course work.

I need to study more, relax more and chat more so that I grow more and have a easier time conversing with fellow students.
