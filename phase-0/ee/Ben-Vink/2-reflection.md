What did I do well this week?
 pushing through roadblocks, and communicating when I get stuck. becoming increasingly comfortable with command lines, and git commands.
 What could I have done to improve?
 creating different branches was fustrating as well as putting to much emphasis on the time limit I had. this lead to increased stress and hampered my sleep
