 What did I do well this week?
 I think getting through the free code camp was a huge accomplishment as there was loads of terminology I had very little understanding prior to starting the course. its difficult for me to see how effective this code camp was thought, as I havent had the chance to apply what I've learnt on a broader project yet
 What could I have done to improve?
 I think taking notes and looking at other resources would help me to improve my javascript quite substantially. I'll be doing this during the next sprints
