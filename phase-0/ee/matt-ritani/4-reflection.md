What did I do well this week?

I think I was the hardest sprint that I have done so far so I think I did well to finish it. Even if it took a while to do. I think I have been doing things at a slightly slower pace and I think it is helping me pick things up better. I think I was quite good for connecting with my cohort to hear about what they are doing is helping as well.


 What could I have done to improve?

 I haven't been as disciplined as in earlier sprints. I think I could have dedicated larger blocks of time.
