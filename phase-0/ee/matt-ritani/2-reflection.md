What did I do well this week?

This week I think I did a better job of reading through stuff before I started so I can better understand the task. I think I worked more effectively and had a better feel for what I was doing generally. I think being onsite is really helping me

 What could I have done to improve?
 
I think I need to take more time to fiddle with things to make them how I want them. I am also aware of what a huge time sink this can be so I think I need a strategy to balance perfection versus learning and delivery.
