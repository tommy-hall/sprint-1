Why is reflection important?

Reflection is important as it gives us an oppurtunity to be self-aware and review how we can do things better. It allows us to be more effective in the long term as we can identify both the good and the bad and use these properties strategically. 

What did I do well this week?

This week I worked consistently - I liked working on the CSS and HTML and I think I made a blog that was simple elegant and effective with the tools I have availble. I think I did a good job of dealing with blocks - or when I was in then searching to get myself out of the block. 

What could I have done to improve?

I think there were times - especially at the end of the day that I was determined to finish something and as I was tired I was very ineffective. They are issues I resolved really quickly the next day with more sleep and distance. Important to be aware of when I am not being effective.
