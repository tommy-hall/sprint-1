What did I do well this week?

I think I managed myself better. I think I was strategic with my time and focussed on getting a MVP product that gave me the learning that I needed. 

What could I have done to improve?
 
 I think I could have spent more time doing research to establish how to do CSS layouts. I think I got frustrated when doing this part and ended up being quite ineffective. It would have been better not to push so hard and understand what I was doing.
