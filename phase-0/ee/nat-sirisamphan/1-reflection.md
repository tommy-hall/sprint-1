Why is reflection important?

Reflection is important as you get to see what you have done well and
start to plan on the next step which is how to improve yourself.

What did I do well this week?

I feel as if I did well on commiting to reading and learning from
concepts even though they were hours long but in the end I did gain
the skills and knowledge needed to push forward through the sprint.

What could I have done to improve?

Taken more breaks so that my brain can process all the information that I
tried to cram.
