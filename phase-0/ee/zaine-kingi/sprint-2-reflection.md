## What did I do well this sprint?
I spent the time to revisit the basics of HTML and CSS, although I found it boring at first, I did learn some new things and revised on old concepts.


## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I feel this sprint took me much longer than expected, part of the reason is that I never noticed the comment thread in Slack containing a comment for me to re-check a pull request. This was part Sprint 2.5 Paying off technical debt.


## What can I improve on next sprint? 
I need to pay more attention to the threads in Slack.
