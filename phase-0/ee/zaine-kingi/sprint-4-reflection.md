## What did I do well this sprint?
This sprint I think I really absorbed the content from the readings well, and learn't a bit about myself
in the process.


## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think I forced myself too much, and as a result found myself re-visiting some of the material over and over to ensure
I was absorbing it.


## What can I improve on next sprint?
In this sprint I felt I took longer than I was expecting, I think for this sprint I put the tasks off a bit too long.
I got caught up on the Free Code Camp course, and ended up completing 2 extra modules and finished JavaScript algorithms, 
then spent too much time re-vising the readings which was probably due to the lack of timeboxing.

So for the next sprint I'm going to timebox myself on the materials.
