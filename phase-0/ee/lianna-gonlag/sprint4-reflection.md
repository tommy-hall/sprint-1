 What did I do well this sprint?
I'm pleased with myself for not spending hours and hours trying to understand (or master) every aspect of JavaScript before moving on; looking back at the last few sprints, I can see how it slowed me down. I feel more adrift now than I did at the end of other sprints, but I also have a clearer view of how Phase 0 works, and I don't worry that I'm going to be lost in the next sprint anymore.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
It feels very egotistical to say I did nothing wrong, but I can't particularly think of anything either. I always aim to spend more time on sprints every week, but I'm also aware of how I need to pace myself to take proper care of myself, and this fortnight I've had both my birthday and a long, dragged-out cold, so having finished within a fortnight is surprisingly good. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
I definitely need to maintain both my pace and restraining my tendency to obsess over details and trying to learn everything. I could do with more other-focused mindfulness too, especially at my day job. I find piano playing to be the most relaxing thing I can do (I'm not great at it, but I get in The Zone easily), so if I can alternate between study and piano I may be able to carve out more time before getting worn out for the night.
