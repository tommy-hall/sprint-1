What did I do well this sprint?

I soaked up the readings and tutorials on CSS and got my tendency to try 
reading everything under control well enough to keep mostly to my 
timebox despite the larger amount of readings for this sprint. 

I also had fun going back to my earlier blog posts and index and tidying 
the code to meet best practice standards as I learned about them. I know 
the whole site is about to be re-done anyway, but I'm pleased with the 
result.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

Interacting with other students for the pull request exercise didn't turn 
out so well. Partially as I'm around at odd hours, but I haven't made enough 
effort to get to know any of them.

I didn't make much of a wishlist re: the CSS Zen Garden, and my blog post 
on the subject got too long; I need to distill my thoughts better before 
I start writing.


What can I improve on next sprint?

Make very sure I hit save before closing this so I don't lose all my typing. 
Again. Also, since I know I'll almost never make the video call check-ins, I 
should set aside the same 10min every week to write something up for the 
slack channel.
