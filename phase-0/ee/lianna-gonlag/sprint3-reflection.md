  What did I do well this sprint?

Most of it, I guess; I kept to my timeboxes fairly well, and kept my overall time on the sprint down fairly well by focusing on what I actually needed to do - learn - instead of over-focusing on getting things perfect. I'm getting better with the code itself, understanding more without needing to look up the mechanics and knowing where to look when I do.

  What didn't I do well this sprint?
My overall time for this sprint was quite long; nearly three weeks, all up. I had trouble finding time, but that said, part of the reason it took me a while is because I wasn't well and resting for a weekend was the better way to take care of myself.
I also got bogged down in the early stages of re-coding my site when I tried to recreate Skeleton's CSS in order to understand it better. I did understand it better, but I wasted several fiddling and typing what I could have read most of it and played with overwrites to see exactly what it was doing. 

  What can I improve on next sprint?
Using more specific date milestones for completing sprints has been suggested, which I'm certainly not against; I think I'll make a little schedule for myself marking out the days when I have time-consuming/exhausting events coming up so I can calculate them out of my remaining time. Right now I'm on track to do every sprint in a fortnight and have almost two weeks of buffer time/review time left over.
