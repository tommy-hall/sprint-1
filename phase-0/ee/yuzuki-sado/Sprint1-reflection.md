What did I do well this sprint?
I believe I understand  the concepts of Github,the command line, HTML and CSS enough to move on to the next sprint. I especially did well with the command line and I enjoy using it outside of the course.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
It took me way longer to complete than I expected. 
What can I improve on next sprint?
As I know now that how many hours roughly I should allocate to finish a sprint, I can manage time effectively.
