 What did I do well this sprint?
 I am getting so much faster to create a blog and link it to my index page.
 My mind set is more process over product.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 It took me a while to understand Skeleton CSS. 
 Hopefully when I come back to this in the future to review, I will understand 
 this more.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Reflecting what I have learnt/read in chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself and 
 keep "Happiness is the default state of mind" in my mind while studying next
 sprint.
