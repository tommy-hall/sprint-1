What did I do well this sprint?
I am now comfortably able to link the html pages I make to my home page. I am getting more efficient at using the command line.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I got a bit confused with Udacity reflection 1 and also git branches and origin master.
I took too long to figure this all out and I then got a bit stressed.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
Don't keep trying and getting frustrated and stressed - mindful meditation.
