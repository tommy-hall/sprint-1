What did I do well in this sprint?

    - Got the first sprint done in a week as planned and am happy with what I have done. 
    
    - Biggest learnings were on CSS, I feel like I have touched on some of the main concepts, but think there is  a lot to learn there still.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

    - Struggled a bit with Toggle. At first the buttons didn't show on the waffle cards. It's also not a habit yet to start and stop recording the time, meaning I had to make manual adjustements to my timesheet on a few occasions.

    - Tried to make things work (CSS) by trial and error which took a lot of time. It's not all lost at I learn doing it, but it would be more efficient to try to find on youtube how to do it. For example I spent a long time trying to create a decent nav bar. Only to then find out that 'nav' is actually a html tag that you can apply CSS too. Could have researched that a bit better before I started.


What can I improve on next sprint?

    - Better time keeping

    - More efficiency in my research

    - Meditate every day (missed a few)
