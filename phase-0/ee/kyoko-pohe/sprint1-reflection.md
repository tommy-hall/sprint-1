 What did I do well this sprint?
    
 I think I was able to get through the sprint quite well without hiccups. I made sure to track time 
 each session on toggl, and seperate each assignment into bits I could manage.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?  What can I improve on next sprint?

 There were a few nights I didn't get around to doing some assignments, so would like to put a bit 
 more time into getting just a bit done each day. All though no complete blocks and managed to get 
 my way through the assignments, I would like to take a bit more time at taking in all the 
 information, and time boxing for additional learning in areas I found I wasn't 100% sure about. One 
 thing I did have a wee bit of trouble with was the technical terms and jargon I haven't heard 
 before (ie, in waffle the task to use css to make the page look great, at first I had to figure out 
 if css was its own program or a document- nothing good ol google/youtube couldn't help with but I 
 think this is where I tend to spend a bit more time due to being completely new to the world of web 
 development.
