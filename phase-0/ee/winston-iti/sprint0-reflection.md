1. What did I do well in this sprint?

I felt git and using gitbash is something I've had to get used to. Sometimes I was unsure if I was about to delete something of the phase-0 github page, but nothing of the kind has happened so far. Using HTML was a breeze, using CSS was similar but I'm not entirely familiar with all the different commands. A bunch of websites on CSS has helped me with that. My design approach is pretty limited, so I decided to keep it simple and and use CSS code as sparingly as possible.

2. What didn't I do well this sprint?

I noticed I kept on forgetting to commit my changes that I staged, resulting in gitbash throwing me an error.

3. What can I improve on for the next sprint?

I should refer myself to my notes and resources. Practicing meditation would probably help me also.
