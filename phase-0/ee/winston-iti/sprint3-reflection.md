Sprint 3 23/05/2018

What did I do well this sprint?

I think I did okay brushing up on my coding fundamentals with the use of FreeCodeCamp.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I think my time management slipped for a week, and hadn't done much study during that time. I let procrastination get to me for a bit, and ended up focusing on some of my other hobbies.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Having a good understanding of what I'm going to studying in the next coming days, so I can prepare the time to study.
