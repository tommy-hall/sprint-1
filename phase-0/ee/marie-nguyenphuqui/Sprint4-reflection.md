What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint I did well on being consistant with my notes. I took all that I could from the FreeCodeCamp Javascript Basics, which I had already completed in the past, but I managed to make this more of a serious experience via having to create structured notes.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I feel like I let myself fall a little bit in a limbo this week. My work hours couldn't let my assist to a check-in and I let the time flow quite a lot, without going back to the material as 'hungry' as a few weeks ago. This is something I am working on. I do feel like I took some holidays of routine life this past week (which is good for my moral) but I desire getting back to it with a certain truth. I got this feeling of too much work to do on my website looks again. Which was a bit vertiginous. 
Fighting this feeling with efficiency is what I didn't do well this sprint.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I need to structure my time and not let me give myself excuses not to do things I want to do. I need to let myself experiment more as well, and have more fun, more than wanting to finish with the target.
