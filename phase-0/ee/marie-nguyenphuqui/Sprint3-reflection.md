What did I do well this sprint?

I was very happy to give myself the time to achieve this sprint - I think it has nearly been a week that I could have called this sprint a day. But I did not feel like I really learnt from where I was. I was more upset about the process. I understood it, I knew how important it was on the meaning of it - but at the time I didn't fully accepted it.
So I am very happy that I pushed through this feeling. That I was able to give myself the time to achieve this sprint for a level of learning that I am satisfied with. I don't leave it with some work that I will have to correct later behind and I am glad for it.
I was feeling like I was doing well on being able to find some time coming at EDA to work on the spot. It is always a better place to learn and it always seems like a faster pace.
As well, on my remote learning I found that I was able to find good tutorials when I was stuck in completing my redesign on my own (like the unrolling index menu). 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

This sprint, I took off the heavy feeling of being in a rush on the positive side. But I got challenged on getting myself consistent on the feeling of doing a real directive project more than potering around. I got more hours at work and got quite sick, so my work on redesigning the website consistently was a bit challenged by these factors on one hand.
But mostly, it is because I likdes the looks of my website before. I got used to what it looked like, I had installed Boostrap on it and had a wee bit of responsiveness from it. I was overall happy with it. 
Changing the whole CSS file, making the website look like I had first drawn it
(which I definitively think I now should rethink when I get some spare time) on the redesign process changed a lot the items I had put on and I often struggled to try to have them back, before implementing what I was first trying to do.
In short I felt a lot like I was fighting on two fronts, and got a bit overwhelmed by it sometime.

What can I improve on next sprint?

The goal that I wanted to achieve was to complete the look for my website that I drew as a wireframe, so in a way I still have some work to do, in contrary to what I said in 'what I did well'. But not in my view of my 'setted goal' for this sprint. So I think next sprint, after I read the assignement I will reflect more about it and find a goal and a learning path that I want to set for myself so I don't get a little bit stuck in limbo like this week.
