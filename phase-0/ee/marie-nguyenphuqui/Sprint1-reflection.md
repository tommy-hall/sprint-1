What did I do well ?

I was very happy about how I managed to allocate my time to EDA on a 8am/3pm broad basis. Having a plan and ticking boxes really pushes me to want to do more.
I felt good about engaging on the Slack channel as well.
I feel quite proud of my notes on Command Line, the terminal and GitHub as well and I did (I try to memorize as much as I can to be faster) refer to them quite a lot.

What didn't I do well ?

I got confused about the Phase 0 common repository, and got much more scared about "experimenting" with it as it involves common ground.
I see already that I need to improve my CSS game, and also go further into documentation on HTML tags. As the EDA documentation was partly on video for these subjects I forgot to take easy reading notes, which makes me less efficient in solving my issues.
Also, on the changing habits matter, I added a 10 minutes meditation break time with a 5 minutes of taking reccord of what I think about it, but this break often change itself to a 40min/1 hour break as I use my phone to access the Headspace app - taking my phone as a tool distract me.

What can I improve next ?

Don't forget to always take notes. 
Keep practicing the daily meditation on my 9am break, but don't spread it more than meditating time and reflection : maybe if this doesn't work and I do need a bigger break time, move meditation try-out around 11:30/12:00 and merge it with lunch.
