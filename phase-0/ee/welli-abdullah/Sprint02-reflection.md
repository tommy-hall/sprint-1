What did I do well this sprint?
I think I did well in understanding the grid based design, the understanding of how HTML/CSS/DOM are used, how they connect to each other.

Picking a simple feature that I want to use and apply it to my website, albeit it is reall a simple feature.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

Still struggling with the emotial intelligence part, how to meditate, how to be mindfull....

Also still a bit confused with the github commands but with more doing/practice I believe it should get easier

 
What can I improve on next sprint?

Same thing, need to improve my attention/not easily distracted.

Improve my time keeping skill and stick to it!
