<h3>What did I do well this sprint?</h3>

<p>
    There are hours of Googling to cement my understanding of arrays and objects and obviusly really happy that I can generate the minesweeper gameboard!
</p>

<h3>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h3>

<p>
    I made some "simple" mistake like placing the Return function on the wrong place in relation to the loop thus the value that the Return function returned was not one that I expected.
</p>
<p>
    Trie to implement a "level selection" for the Minesweeper board but could not figure out how to "reset" the boarc cirrectly for each selection. In the end had to abandon it cause already exceed the time block.

<h3>What can I improve on next sprint?</h3>

<p>Implementing the Siberian North Railroad exercise as soon as I encounter a block</p>
