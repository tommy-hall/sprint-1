What did I do well this sprint?

I played around with html/css a long time ago and it is great that I still remember the html part, not so much on the css part and that where Google  come in handy.


 What didn't I do well this sprint?

Mainly time management. I keep forgetting to turn on Toggle!


 What can I improve on next sprint?

Remember to turn on Toggle :-)
Implement the Pomodoro technique better, don't think that I need to get everything done in one go.
