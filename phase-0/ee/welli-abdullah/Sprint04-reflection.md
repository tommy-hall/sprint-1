What did I do well this sprint?
    I think I did the basic Javascripts pretty well, under the suggested 10 hours

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I am still a bit confused on the difference between == and ===, how they are used etc.

    Also need more practice on the Object's properties

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    Practice, practice, practice.
