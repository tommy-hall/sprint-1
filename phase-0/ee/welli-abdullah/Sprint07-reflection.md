<h3>What did I do well this sprint?</h3>

<p>
    I believe I did quite well with the basic algorithm scripting
    exercise from freecodecamp.org
</p>
<p>
    There are some exercises that I understand how to do them e.g. pseudocode but still needs to figure out which 
    Javascript functions I need to use.
</p>

<h3>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h3>

<p>
    On the other hand, most of the Intermediate exercises are still too advanced for me
</p>
<p>
    Also need to Google several articles on recursive to make sure I really get it.
