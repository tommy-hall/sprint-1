What did I do well this sprint?
I think I made a pretty cool web page. Real basic, looks like crap, but works well.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't pay enough attention to the Udacity tutorials which should have given me a clear picture of postioning my content. Before I start sprint 4, I plan to go through the Udacity tutorials again.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I plan to do the readings and tutorials during the week. And then, on my weekends, get into the git bash and visual studio coding tasks
