What did I do well in this sprint?
The fact that I enjoyed working on this sprint helped me. I was glad to exercise more with JavaScript and that this topic was narrowed down enough for me to understand what I was doing.

What didn't I do well in this sprint?
The fact that I went away for the weekend didn't help matters. I went 2 days without any work.


What can I improve on next sprint?
Time management priorities. At least spend a few hours on my sprint during the weekend. I am really enjoying what I do.
