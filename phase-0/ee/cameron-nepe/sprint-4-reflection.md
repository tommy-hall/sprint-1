What did I do well in this sprint?
I actually think overall I did well. I have a love / hate relationship with JavaScript and so perservere was what I did well.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Laziness, no effort and not making it a daily habit. I am frustrated with myself. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
Need to settle down, get into a good daily habit around my job. Reach out to my fellow cohort friends.
