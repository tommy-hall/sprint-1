What did I do well this sprint?
I believe I created a good wireframe layout that was both not too overcomplicated and worked with the framework. I made sure that I was following the layout set by said framework before focusing on anything else to my best ability. worked out any issues that I had with the layout with consise effort. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I feel like I could have stuck to using the framework set out a bit more. there were a few parts of the design that I couldn't replicate correctly with the classes in the skeleton code, and had to use other means to make it work. Because of this a few bits of my code are a little skewey. I could have managed my css better in terms of scaling as well.

What could I do better next sprint?
I am going to try using the resources given a bit better to make sure everything is concise. It's all well and good creating something that works, but if I'm going to be building on this it would be better to have something that works consistently.
