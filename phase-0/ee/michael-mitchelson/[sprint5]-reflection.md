What did i do well this sprint?
I wrote Javascript in a laid out and well documented manner so that anyone reading my code would understand what it is about. I made sure to timebox myself in doing a bit of a refreshment when it came to going over javascript code. I did well in changing the elements into doing certain things depending on mouse movements.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't do well with the blog writing. I sometimes run out of stuff to say and feel like what I'm writing doesn't make any sense. I didn't do well with allocating my time. I feel I could have made sure everything was structured when it came to what to work on when.


What could I improve on for next sprint?
I need to learn to turn my toggl timer off when i'm supposed to. I fell asleep with it on and it logged my hours overnight. I need to get used to Body Scanning and dedicating 40-ish mins to meditation.
