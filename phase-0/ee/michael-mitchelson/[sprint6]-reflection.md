What did I do well this sprint?
I worked through all of the tasks in the sprint in a pretty reasonable amount of time. when it came to writing the code and understanding where everything came from, I did well in noting down how everything in lib worked and how it should be implemented in the code. I did well in making efficient and clean code that doesn't take up a lot of space, and minimised the amount of processes needed. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I found myself stuck at certian points, forgetting that certian things could be implemented in the code. for example forgetting that the for loop could take the "in" argument to easily parse through the board object. It took me a while in researching to find out that that could be done. I also didn't really comment anything in the code I wrote. part of me feels like I should have but I also feel that the code is pretty well self documented so i'm a bit torn.

What could I do better for next sprint?
I could rely on some of the other troubleshooting ideas from the last sprint's technical blog. I find myself stubbornly trying to solve things on my own. I need to realise that there are people willing to help me with any issues I have and that I can trust them to help.
