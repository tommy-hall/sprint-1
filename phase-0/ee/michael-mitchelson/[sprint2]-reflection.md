1 What did I do well this sprint?

    I believe I did well on covering the boxifying method and the making changes to my blog site using the boxifying method. I did well in the note taking when it came to covering the udacity content and seeing how the changes in structure can sharpen up a website.

2   what didn't I do well this sprint?

    I didn't do well in the following up of my progress with the rest of the phase 0 group. I need to make sure I'm documenting where I'm at with my workload and that everyone knows what I'm having issues with when it comes to the code I write.

3   What can I improve on next sprint?
    
    I will make sure that I am posting my status to the group. I'll make sure that I am talking to the group about any issues or
    queries that I have.
