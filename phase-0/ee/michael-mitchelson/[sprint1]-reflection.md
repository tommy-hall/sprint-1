1: What did I do well this sprint?

    I managed to work through the setup of the resources needed for the course with github without any real issue.
    I was able to organise my files out when it came to my blog website and phase.0 repo in an orderly manner. 
    I created a rough but workable html and css page by trial and error.

2:  What didn't I do well this sprint?
    Time management, I need to make sure I'm dedicating the appropriate amount of time to each section, and to read through the whole sprint to understand where my time is best suited.
3:
    Organising myself around the courseload to make sure that I am punctual with each completion
