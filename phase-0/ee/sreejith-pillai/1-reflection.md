Reflection is the way one can learn from their experience. It helps to make connection and get insights on the experience. It transfers the experience from being a short term memory to long term learning which can be used in the future in a different problem or situation.

I started with the phase 0 curriculum, managed to complete some tasks, work a bit on GIT and GITHUB. I was able to spend sometime with the subject and was motivated.

I could have revised a bit about html, css and get started with some more assignments. I need to manage my down time effectively and productively. Need to engage myself and immerse more in the coding zone. This will increase the motivation to do more.
