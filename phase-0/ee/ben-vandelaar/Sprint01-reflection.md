 Q:What didn't I do well this sprint?
    A: Deffinatly need to work on slowing my self down and taking the time with my code to keep it clean and simple making sure it doesn't get a mind of it's own and run off on me. Also need to work on seting goals for the timelogs, stopping when the 25mins are up and reflecting on what I've accomplished. 
    
 Q:What can I improve on next sprint?
    A: Coding knowledge. Time keeping and management. And remembering that this is a learning experience and that it doesn't have to be perfect.
