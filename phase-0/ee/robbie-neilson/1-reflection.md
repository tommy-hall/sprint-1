What did I do well this sprint?  I did some great study to learn basic concepts I struggled with. I did pretty good with the html and CSS basics and am feeling happy with my understanding of the terminal.
 What didn't I do well this sprint? Managing time to fit the study in. In the end I had to reschedule my days dramatically to create time, a plus for the learning but not a solution for regular life. I got held up several times on basic things and struggled to find information on issues so small they are generally assumed to be known.
 What can I improve on next sprint? I pushed to find all the answers myself first (because I tend to want to ask first) but on reflection see some of those simple things could be resolved very quickly by asking questions. I have been reflecting on the balance of this in my progress. Creating a daily routine to continue my work is a great next step.
