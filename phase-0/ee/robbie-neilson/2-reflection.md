What did I do well this sprint?
    This sprint I learned a lot of great html and css tricks and things. I was slow to figure out the dev tools in chrome but once I had it I made good use of it.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I was terrible with my time management. The 80% rule is key to my learning here I think.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
    Better time management. Focus on key points, stick to relevant things.
