What did I do well this sprint?

I practised stopping and breathing, before deciding on a plan of attack when reaching particular obstacles. I also relied on my wife's faster Macbook to reduce stress as my old 2010 unit is starting to struggle. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't do well on fixing my count function properly and keeping track of old code. I started writing things up twice and that caused some problems.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Dry code and continue to use a faster computer to reduce stress levels.
