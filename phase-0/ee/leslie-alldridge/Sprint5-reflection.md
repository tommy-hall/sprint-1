What did I do well this sprint?
I really enjoyed the self awareness reading and I felt comfortable with Javascript as I've used it in the past.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Motivation - this is rarely an issue but I've been feeling quite tired from my trip to Napier and half marathon.


What can I improve on next sprint?
Bring a smile to work every day and wear my listening ears. I feel like my listening awareness dimished slightly.
