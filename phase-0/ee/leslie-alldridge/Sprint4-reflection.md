What did I do well this sprint?

    I found Javascript wasn't too bad and flew through the content as I've studied it before at university (only 100 level papers).
 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I didn't do well understanding the questions on the website. I found it wasn't my coding knowledge that was missing (I could easily write the answer), but I was missing the point of the question. Maybe the question / situation wasn't descriptive enough..I did read on one hint page that others also found it unclear what we're coding. 
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 
    Spending more time understanding the question before I dive into coding.
