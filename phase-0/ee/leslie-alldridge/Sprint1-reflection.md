What did I do well this sprint?

I nailed the top navbar, and hope to perfect this further when incorporating Bootstrap. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

A few late nights figuring out really minimal issues. I probably should've slept and worked on it in the morning with a fresh mind.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Time management and getting in lots of rest.
