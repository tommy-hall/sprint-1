What did I do well in this sprint?

I feel I coped well with problem solving and researching when I came accross an authentication error with Git as part of working on this sprint. I also think
I have gained a good understanding of the principles of working with HTML & CSS as well as the areas that I might come across problems with in future as I create
more complex stylesheets. This should hopefully help me with solving those problems as I come across them. Also I have learnt some best practices regarding use of
selectors that should hopefully lead to better code.

What didn't I do well in this sprint?

I again wish I had better time managed this sprint. The open ended nature of the CSS Zen garden task meant that I spent quite a lot of time at that point looking at
the CSS elements of different websites. Also I felt I needed a better understanding of the function of CSS properties in order to complete that task properly so spent
quite a lot of time reading up on these. While this may be useful in future I could certainly have completed the sprint without this.

What can I improve on next sprint?

In the next sprint I plan to work more efficiently during weeknights so that I can take some of the pressure off having to complete the majority of the sprint on the weekends
in case there is something that interrupts that.
