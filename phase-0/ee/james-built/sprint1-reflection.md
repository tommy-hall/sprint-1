What did I do well in this sprint?

    I did a good job of methodically working through the tasks assigned, as well as researching further
    where I wanted to find out more information. I also think I did a good job of practicing the mechanical
    tasks of using the terminal as well as making sure to learn the commands and how to use them.

What didn't I do well in this sprint?

    I would have liked to have completed the sprint quicker than I have done. A combination of other commitments
    as well as working into a good routine and forming new habits has meant this has taken longer than I would have liked.
    I'm using this as motivation to improve however and stretch myself further on the next one.

What can I improve on next sprint?

    I plan to continue with my physical and mental training which will put me in the best possible space for effective learning.
    I will also make much better use of techniques such as pomodoro to make sure I am effectively using my time and being
    accountable for how it is spent, this is my most precious resource.
