The last sprint of Phase 0! Well done on making it this far. You've grappled with a lot of concepts and you're nearly ready for bootcamp.

>The term _open source_ refers to something that can be modified and shared because its design is publicly accessible. - [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)

The strong open source community has fuelled the growth of the internet. Most websites and web applications are hosted by machines running the open source operating system Linux. As a web developer, you'll be constantly using libraries, frameworks and media with open source licenses.

Open source is based on the idea that by sharing what we know and build we can build a better future together. Every year, Enspiral hosts the [Open Source // Open Society Conference](http://www.opensourceopensociety.com/), to help facilitate this.

## Concepts

We aren't introducing new concepts this sprint (unless you count open source!) However, there's an assignment that gives you room to play with a creative JavaScript project. If you feel you're not too strong on any of the concepts we've already covered in Phase 0, try using some of those ideas in your creation as practice.

Keep this sprint light: review and refocus, ready for bootcamp! Revisit concepts you found difficult. Play with them in code. Google them. Discuss them with your cohort.


## Assignments and resources

Find your assignments on the [Phase-0 waffle board](https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0) and assigned to you. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=**yourGithubUserName**`
<br>
You will need to replace 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=harrison-symes`


## Next steps

1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts


## Handing in your work

- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task.
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
