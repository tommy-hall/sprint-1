## Wow.
Visit [Patatap](http://www.patatap.com/) to exerience Synesthesia.
Think about how you could build this - launching sound clips and appending divs and animations on key events... nothing too tricky...

## Habits

<!-- learn > develop > practice -->
1. Reflect
2. Tidy  
3. *Play*
5. *Perservere*
6. **Explore**

You can do many things with JavaScript. Even [this](https://youtu.be/pmp_hCg6jGQ?t=1m32s). There's a big world out there for you to explore...

## Concepts

Don't get too stuck on digesting all of the events resource before you've started the assignments! You'll be referring back to it again, and some of it will make more sense when you've had a chance to see the code in action.

* [JavaScript events and CSS classes](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/blob/master/resources/js-events-and-css-classes-ARTICLE/README.md)
* [Debugging](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/resources/js-debugging-ARTICLE)

## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on the [Phase-0 waffle board](https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0) and assigned to you. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=**yourGithubUserName**`
<br>
You will need to replace 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=harrison-symes`

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts

## Handing in your work
- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task.
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
