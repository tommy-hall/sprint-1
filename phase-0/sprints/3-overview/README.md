## Habits

1. *Reflection*
2. *Tidy*

**Play** is the habit of staying curious and creative. To learn challenging concepts and solve the complex problems you'll face, you'll need to fully engage yourself, try new things and **not be afraid of failure**.
> Play is the highest form of research. — Albert Einstein
