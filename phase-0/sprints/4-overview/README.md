# Sprint #4

> Ko te manu e kai ana i te miro, nona te ngahere.<br>Engari, ko te manu e kai ana i te matauranga, nona te ao.<br>
> *The one who partakes of the flora and fauna, that will be their domain.<br>The one who engages in education, opportunities are boundless.* <br>  

##Wow.
Now that you're a ~~nerd~~ programmer, you'll appreciate the genius of the webcomic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1513/)
and maybe this [gif depicting a common CSS experience](http://imgur.com/gallery/Q3cUg29)

## Habits

<!-- learn > develop > practice -->
1. Reflection
2. *Tidy*      
3. *Play*    
4. **Perservere**

JavaScript is hard. You'll need perserverence to keep working your way through unfamiliar territory, strange errors and tricky concepts. Keep calm and carry on - it'll help both you and those you're working with.

>If you are going through hell, keep going. â€” Winston Churchill

## Concepts

JavaScript is a scripting language, created to make HTML pages dynamic. It turns the web into something more powerful than just interlinked HTML pages.

JavaScript allows you to build apps that handle data, logic, interactivity and advanced connectivity. These awesome additions are the difference between a 'website' and a 'web app'.

This sprint, you'll be building a solid foundation of JavaScript and practicing pseudocoding to keep you from getting lost in code syntax!

## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on the [Phase-0 waffle board](https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0) and assigned to you. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=**yourGithubUserName**`
<br>
You will need to replace 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=harrison-symes`

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts

## Handing in your work
- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task.
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
