# Sprint #8

> He ora te whakapiri<br>
> He mate te whakatariri<br>
> *There is strength in unity*<br>
> *Defeat in anger*<br>

## Wow.
Coding gives you the ability to express information in new ways. Data visualisation is a booming area, often driven by the [JavaScript library D3](http://d3js.org/). Here's a beautiful example exploring [Obama's 2013 budget](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html). Students have played with D3 during the bootcamp, and alumni in Dev Academy Consulting have used it to present data in this [report for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand](http://annualreport.rbnz.govt.nz/financial-highlights#key-points).

## Concepts

We've covered all the concepts you need for bootcamp, and we're happy these have all been exercised in the assignments you've already been given. This sprint you'll be finishing all your assignments, leaving the final sprint 9 free to review and reflect before bootcamp.

* [Self care](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/resources/self-care-ARTICLE/README.md)
* [Writing short functions](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/resources/js-writing-short-functions-ARTICLE/README.md)


## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on the [Phase-0 waffle board](https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0) and assigned to you. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=**yourGithubUserName**`
<br>
You will need to replace 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/phase-0/phase-0?assigned=harrison-symes`

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts

## Handing in your work
- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task.
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
